// BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

// [9, 4, 1, 6, 20, 15, 99]

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
//BFS (DFS will take a long time to complete)

//If the tree is very wide:
//DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//DFS (BFS will take a long time to complete, and DFS will find solutions quicker than BFS in that case )

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//DFS (This is what DFS is built for)

//Finding the shortest path:
//BFS (BFS is the best way to find the shortest path)
